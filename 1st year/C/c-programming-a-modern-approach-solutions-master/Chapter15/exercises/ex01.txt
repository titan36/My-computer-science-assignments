Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" Chapter 15, Exercise 1

Section 15.1 listed several advantages of dividing a program into multiple
source files.

(a) Describe several other advantages.

1. It's not really practical to allow many programmers to edit a single source file.   Splitting a source file into multiple smaller files has the added benefit of
   allowing shared responsability on a single project.

2. Having clear well defined file responsability allows easier code reuse in a
   project. Keeping files small and streamlined this way makes it easier to
   identify bugs and problems. Using a single source file for a task in a project
   has the added benefit of being.. used a lot, which can potentially identify
   problems which may well be hidden during development and may be discovered
   after heavy usage in deployment.

3. Smaller source files are generally easier to understand and digest.

(b) Describe some disadvantages.

1. Splitting an already large program into smaller logical section can be time
   consuming and a bit confusing.

2. Logical reasoning can be subjective; Disagreements on how the program should
   be split can arise.

3. Can add uneeded complexity.
