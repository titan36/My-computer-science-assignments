Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" Chapter 15, Exercise 2

Which of the following should not be put in a head file? Why not?
(a) Function prototypes
(b) Function definitions
    Should not be kept in a header file. C expects functions to be defined exactly
    once. If a function in a header file is included multiple times, then the program
    will contain multiple defintions. 
(c) Macro defintiions
(d) Type definitions
