 * Solution to "C Programming A Modern Approach" chapter 7, programming project 1
 * 
 *  The square2.c program of section 6.3 will fail (usually by printing strange answers)
 *  if i * i exceeds the maximum int value. Run the program and determine the smallest
 *  value of n that causes failure. Try changing the type of i to short and running 
 *  the program again. (Don't forget to update the conversion specifications in the call
 *  of printf!) Then try long. From these experiments, what can you conclude about the number 
 *  of bits used to store integer types on your machine?
