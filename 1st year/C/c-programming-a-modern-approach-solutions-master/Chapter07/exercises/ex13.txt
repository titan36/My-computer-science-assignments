Q: Assume that a program contains the following declarations:

char c = '\1';
short s = 2;
int i = -3;
long m = 5;
float f = 6.5f;
double d = 7.5;

Give the value and the type of each expression listed below:

(a) c * i 	  (c) f / c	   (e) f - d
(b) s + m	  (d) d / s	   (f) (int)f

A:

(a) -3, int	  (c) 6.5, float   (e) -1.0, double
(b) 7, long	  (d) 3.75, double (f) 6, int
