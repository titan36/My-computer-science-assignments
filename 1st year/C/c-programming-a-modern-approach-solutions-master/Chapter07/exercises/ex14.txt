Solution to "C Programming A Modern Approach" chapter 7, exercise 14
:
Q: Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of f correctly
   (assuming that f and frac_part are float variables)?

   float frac_part, f;
   frac_part = f - (int)f;

   if not, what's the problem?

A: Sort of, the order of presendence (cast, sub, assign) makes the result a float value of 0.6. 
   (5.6 - 5)
