Solution to "C Programming A Modern Approach" chapter 7, exercise 10

Q: Suppose that i is a variable of type int, j is a variable of type long, and k
   is a variable of type unsigned int. What is the expression i + (int)j * k

K is the largest variable after j has been cast. Usual arithmetic conversion rules
dictate that i and j be promoted to K. The type of the expression is unsigned int.
