Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 21, exercise 5

The islower function, which belongs to <ctype.h>, tests whether a character is a
legal lower case letter. Why would the following macro version of islower not be
legal according to the C standard? (You may assume that the character set is ASCII).

#define islower(c) ((c) >= 'a' && (c) <= 'z')

As seen in a previous chapter, using a macro such as this runs the possibility of
evaluating the argument c twice. The C standard specifies that a macro must only
evaluate it's arguments exactly once.
