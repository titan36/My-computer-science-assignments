Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 21, exercise 3

When a macro hides a function, which come first in the header file: The macro
definition or the function prototype? Justify your answer.

The function prototype must always come before the macro. Without the prototype
the macro cannot be expanded properly. GCC won't even let you place the prototype
and macro in the wrong order.
