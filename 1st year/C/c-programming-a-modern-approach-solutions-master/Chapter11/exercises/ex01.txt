Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 11, exercise 1.

"If i is a variable and p points to i, which of the following expressions are
aliases for i?"

Aliasing is using multiple names to access the same area of memory. p is an alias
for i aslong as it references the same location as i.

(a) *p
*p is an alias for i. Changing *p will change i.

(b) &p
&p is not an alias for i. &p contains the address of p.

(c) *&p
Dereferencing the address of p. Not an alias

(d) &*p
The address of the dereferenced value of p. Not an alias.

(e) *i
i is an int, not  a pointer. Not a alias.

(f) &i
Not an alias

(g) *&i
Dereferencing the address of i, an alias.

(h) &*i
i is still an int type, cannot use pointer operators.

a and g are aliases.
