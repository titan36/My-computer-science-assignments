Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 11, exercise 2.

"If i is an int variable and p and q are pointers to int, which of the following
assignments are legal?"

int i, *p, *q;

(a) p = i;
Illegal, p is an pointer.

(b) *p = &i;
Illegal, *p is an integer variable, &i is a pointer to int.

(c) &p = q;
Illegal. &p is a pointer to pinter to an integer, q is pointer to int.

(d) p = &q;
Illegal.

(e) p = *&q;
Legal

(f) p = q;
Legal, Both p and q are pointers to integers.

(g) p = *q;
Illegal

(h) *p = q;
Illegal

(i) *p = *q;
Legal
