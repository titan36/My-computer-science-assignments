 * Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 11 programming project 4
 *
 * Modify the poker.c program of section 10.5 by moving all external variables
 * into main and modifying function so that they communicate by passing arguments.
 * The analyze_hand function needs to change the straight, flush, four, three, and
 * pairs variable so it will have to be passed pointers to those variables.
