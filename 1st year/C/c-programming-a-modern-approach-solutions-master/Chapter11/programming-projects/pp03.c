 * Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 11 programming project 3
 *
 * Modify programming project from chapter 6 so that includes the following function
 *
 * void reduce(int numerator, int denominator, int *reduced_numerator,
 * 	       int *reduced denominator);
 *
 * numerator and denominator are the numerator and denominator of a fraction.
 * reduced_numerator and reduced_denominator are pointers to variables in which
 * the function will store the numerator and denominator of the fraction once it has
 * been reduced to lowest terms.
