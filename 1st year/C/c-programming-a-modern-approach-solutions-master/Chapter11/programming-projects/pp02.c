 * Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 11 programming project 2
 *
 * Modify programming project 8 from Chapter 5 so that it includes the following
 * function:
 *
 * void find_closest_flight(int destired_time, int *departure_time, int* arrival_time);
 *
 * This function will find the flight whose depature time is closest to desired_time
 * (expressed in minutes since midnight). It will store the departure and arrival
 * times of this flight (also expressed in minutes since midnight) in the variables
 * pointed to by departure and arrival_time, respectively.
