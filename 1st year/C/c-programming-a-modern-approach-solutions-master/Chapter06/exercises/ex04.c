   Solution to "C Programming: A Modern Approach" Chapter 6, exericse 4 
  
Q: Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (Assuming that the loop
   bodies are the same) ?
 
(a) for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) ...
(b) for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ...
(c) for (i = 0; i++ < 10; ) ... 

c is different as the increment statement is in the loops conditional statement and the increment statment
is omitted.
