Q: Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the loop 
bodies are the same) ? 

(a) while (i < 10) {...}
(b) for (; i < 10; ) {...}
(c) do {...} while (i < 10); 

a and b are the same, as the assignment statement and increment operator are ommited from b. 
c while similar, c will check its termination condition always after executing the loop body. 
a and b check before.
