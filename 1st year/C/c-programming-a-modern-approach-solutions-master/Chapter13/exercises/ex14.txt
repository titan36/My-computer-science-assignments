Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 14

What does the following program print?

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
	char s[] = "Hsjodi", *p;
	for (p = s; *p; p++)
		--*p;
	puts(s);
	return 0;
}

This program will loop through string s. The indirection + decrement statement on 
line 11 will cause each letter in the string to move back 1 position in the ascii
table.

H(72) becomes G(71) and s(115) becomes r(114) and so on. This program will output
the word "Grinch".
