Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 10

The following function supposedly creates an identical copy of a string. 
What's wrong with the function?

char *duplicate(const char *p){
	char *q;
	strcopy(q, p);
	return q;
}

q is a pointer to a char, but there is no way to deduce that's a string with
a length. There is also no way to ensure that q can fit p.
