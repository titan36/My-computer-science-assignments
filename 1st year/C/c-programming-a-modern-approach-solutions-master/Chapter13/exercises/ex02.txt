Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 2

"Suppose that p has been declared as follows:
char *p = "abc";

Which of the following calls are legal? Show the output produced
by each legal call, and explain why the others are illegal"

a. putchar(p);
Ilegal, putchar expects a character.

b. putchar(*p);
Legal. *p is a reference to the first element of array p, and thus should print a. 

c. puts(p);
Legal. puts expects a string. The output is abc

d. puts(*p);
Ilegal, puts requires a string. *p is a reference to the first element of an array, which is an integer.
