Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 15

Let f be the following function:

int f(char *s, char *t){
	char *p1, *p2;
	for(p1 = s; *p1; p++){
		for(p2 = t; *p2; p2++){
			if(*p1 == *p2) break
		if (*p2 == '\0') break;
		}
	}
	return p1 - s;
}

(a) What is the value of f("abcd", "babc")? - 3
(b) What is the value of f("abcd", "bcd")? - 0
(c) In general, what value does f return when passed two strings s and t?
The function f in general will return the first address character that is in S and not in T.
