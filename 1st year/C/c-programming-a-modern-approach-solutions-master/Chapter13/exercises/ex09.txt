Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 9

What will be the value of the string s1 after the following statements have been
executed?

strcopy(s1, "computer");
strcopy(s2, "science");
if (strcmp(s1, s2) < 0)
	strcat(s1, s2);
else
	strcat(s2, s1);
s1[strlen(s1) -6] = '\0';

s1 = computer
s2 = science

strcmp compares strings lexicographically, like a dictionary, so a is less than z,
d is more than c etc. In this case, the result of strcmp will be < 0. 

strcat will append science to the string computer to make "computerscience\0".

The length of "computerscience" is 15 as strlen returns the string length not
including the null terminator.

s1 = computers\0
