Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 7

Suppose that str is an array of characters. Which one of the following statements
is not equivalent to the other three?

char str[] = "hello";

(a) *str = 0;
(b) str[0] = '\0'
(c) strcpy(str, "")
(d) strcat(str, "")

d is the malcontent! a, b and c in various ways create an empty string. a and b 
achieve this by making the first character of the string a null terminator character. c copies an empty string into str.
d appends an empty string to the end of str, rather than the start.
