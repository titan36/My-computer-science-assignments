Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 3

"Suppose that we call scanf as follows:
	scanf("%d%s%d", &i, s, &j);
If the user enters 12abc34 56def78, what will be the values of i, s and j
after the call?"

scanf will read input until it reaches a space or an input that does not match
the format specifier. The result of this statement will be:

i = 12. Input will stop at the character a
s = abc34. Input will top at the space.
j = 56. The rest of the input is discarded.
