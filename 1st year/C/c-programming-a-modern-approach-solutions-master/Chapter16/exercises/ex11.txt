Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" Chapter 16, Exercise 11

Suppose that s is the following struct:
	struct {
		double a;
		union {
			char b[4];
			double c;
			int d;
		} e;
		char f[4];
	}s;

if char values occupy one byte, int values occupy four bytes, and double values occupy
eight bytes, how much space will a C compiler allocate for?

Unions will only store enough data for the larger type in it's members, in this
case it's a double, of 8 bytes. The structure contains a double, and a char array
4 bytes in length.

Size of struct = 8 bytes + 8 bytes + 4 bytes = 20 bytes.
