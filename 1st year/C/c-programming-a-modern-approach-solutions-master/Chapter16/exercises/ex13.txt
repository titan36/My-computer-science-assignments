Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" Chapter 16, Exercise 13

Suppose that s is the following structure (point is a structure tag declared in ex10):

	struct shape {
		int shape_kind;
		struct point center;
		union {
			struct {
				int height, width;
			} rectangle;
			struct {
				int radius;
			} circle;
		} u;
	} s;

If the value of shape_kind is RECTANGLE, the height and width members store the dimen-
sions of a rectangle. If the value of shape_kind is CIRCLE the radius member stores
the radius of a circle. Indicate which of the following statements are legal, and show
how to repair the ones that aren't:

(a) s.shape_kind = RECTANGLE;
    Legal
(b) s.center.x = 10;
    Legal
(c) s.height = 25;
    Illegal, s.u.rectangle.height = 25;
(d) s.u.rectangle.width = 8;
    Legal
(e) s.u.circle = 5;
    Illegal, set kind to CIRCLE first
(f) s.u.radius = 5;
    Illegal s.u.circle.radius = 5;
