Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" Chapter 16, Exercise 12

Support that u is the following union:

	union {
		double a;
		struct {
			char b[4];
			double c;
			int d;
		} e;
		char f[4];
	} u;

Solve the same as exercise 11. How much space will a C compiler allocate for union u?

size of u = 4 bytes + 8 bytes + 4 bytes = 16 bytes.
