Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 22, exercise 6

Is there any different between the printf conversion specifications %.4d and %04d? If so
explain what it is.

When precision is used with an integer value, it specifies the minimum number of digits. Leading
zeroes will be added if the number has fewer than specified.

%04d specifies a minimum field width of 4, with padded leading zeroes.

They are the same.
