Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 22, exercise 11

The following loop appears in the fcopy.c program:

	while((ch = getc(source_fp)) != EOF)
	  	putc(ch, dest_fp);

Supose that we neglected to put parentheses around ch = getc(source_fp):

	while(ch = (getc(source_fp) != EOF))
		putc(ch, dest_fp);

Would the program compile without an error? If so, what would the program 
do when it's run?

There is an issue with the order of precedence in the program. The != 
operator has a greater precedence than assignment. The program will first
test that getc(source_fp) does not equal EOF and return a boolean value.
which is then assigned to ch. ch will be equal to 1 (SOH) until it hits
EOF, then it will be 0 (NUL)
