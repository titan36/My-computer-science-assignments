Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 22, exercise 3

Find the error in the following program and show how to fix it:

	FILE *fp;

	if(fp = fopen(filename, "r")){
		// Read characters until nd of file
	}
	fclose(fp);

The program never tests fp for a NULL pointer. Closing a NULL pointer
results in an error. 

FILE *fp

if((fp = fopen(filename, "r")) != NULL){
	// read charachers
} else {
	// handle error, exit
}
