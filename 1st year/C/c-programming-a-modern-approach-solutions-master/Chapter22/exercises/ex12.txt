Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 22, exercise 12

Find the error in the following function and show how to fix it.

	int count_periods(const char *filename){
		FILE *fp;
		int n = 0;
	
		if((fp = fopen(filename, "r")) != NULL){
			while(fgetc(fp) != EOF)
				if(fgetc(fp) == '.')
					n++;	
			fclose(fp);
		}
		return n;
	}

	
The error is that fgetc is called twice. In each call of the function a new charact-
er is taken from it's argument, in effect skipping a letter.
