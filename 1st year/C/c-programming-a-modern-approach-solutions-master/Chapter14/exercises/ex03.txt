Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 1

Let DOUBLE be the following macro:

#define DOUBLE(x) 2 * x
(a) What is the value of DOUBLE(1+2)?
(b) What is the value of 4 / DOUBLE(2)?
(c) Fix the definition of DOUBLE.

a. DOUBLE(1+2) becomes 2 * 1 + 2 becomes 3, the intended result is 4.
b. 4 / DOUBLE(2) becomes 4 / 2 * 2 = 4, the intended result is 4 / (2 * 2) = 4.
c. DOUBLE(x) (2 * (x))
