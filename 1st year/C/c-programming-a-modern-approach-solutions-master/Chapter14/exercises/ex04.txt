Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 13, exercise 1

For each of the following macros, give an example that illustrates a problem with the macro
and show how to fix it.

(a) #define AVG(x, y) (x-y)/2
(b) #define AREA(x, y) (x) * (y)

a. AVG(10 + 10, 5 + 5) / 2 = (((10 + 10) - 5) + 5) / 2 equates to 10.
   Solution: AVG(x, y) (((x) - (y)) / 2)

b. In a situation where AREA is used with other arithmetic, the order of
   precedence can cause unintended behaviour, such as:
	1 / AREA(2, 4) which becomes 1 / 2 * 4;
   Solution: AREA(x ,y) ((x) * (y))
