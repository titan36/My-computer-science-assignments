Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 14, exercise 5

Let TOUPPER be the following macro:
#define TOUPPER(c) ('a' <= (c) && (c) <= 'z' ? (c) - 'a' + 'A' : (c))

Let s be a string and let i be an int variable. Show the output produced by each
of the following program fragments.

(a) strcpy(s, "abcd");
    i = 0;
    putchar(TOUPPER(s[++i]));

    The preprocesser will replace TOUPPER instance with the replacement list. It will test s[1] and s[2] to be 
    between a and z, which is true and will then captalize s[3] and print to standard output, which is the 
    character 'D'

(b) strcpy(s, "0123");
    i = 0;
    putchar(TOUPPER(s[++i]));

    The output will be character 2.
