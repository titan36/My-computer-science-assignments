Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 18, exercise 6

The following function is supposed to print an error message. Each message is 
preceeded by an integer, indicating the number of times the function has been called
unfortunately, the function always displays 1 as the number of the error message.
Locate the error and show how to fix it without making any changes outside the 
function

void print_error(const char *message){
	int n = 1;
	printf("Error %d: %s", n++, message);
}

In the function above the variable has block scope, and is lost after the block
exits, and reinitialised to 1 each time the function is called.

The function below fixes this with a static variable that has static storage
duration, the value of n is kept and incremented with each call.

void print_error(const char *message){
	static int n = 1;
	printf("Error %d: %s", n++, message);
}
