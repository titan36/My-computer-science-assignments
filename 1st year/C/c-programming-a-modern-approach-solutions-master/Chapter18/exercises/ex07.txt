Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 18, exercise 7

Suppose that we declare x to be a const object. Which one of the following
statements about x is false?

(a) If x of is type int, it can be used as the value of a case label in a switch
    statement.

	False, const objects cannot be used in constant expressions, like that of
	a switch case. Constant in C refers to literal constants such as 1,2,3 or
	'a', 'b', 'c'. In this sense, contant objects are not constants.

(b) The compiler will check that no assignment is made to x.

(c) x is subject to the same scope rules as variables.

(d) x can be of any type.
