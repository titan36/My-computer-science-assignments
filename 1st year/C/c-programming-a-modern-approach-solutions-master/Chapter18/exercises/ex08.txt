Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 18, exercise 8

Write a complete description of the type of x as specified by each of the following
declarations.

(a) char (*x[10])(int);
	x is an array of 10 pointers to functions with an integer argument that return char

(b) int (*x(int))[5];
	x is a function with 1 int argument that returns a pointer to an array of 5 integers.

(c) float *(*x(void))(int);
	x is a function that has no parameters
	that returns a pointer to a function with one integer argument
	that returns a pointer to a float

(d) void (*x(int, void (*y)(int)))(int);
	x is a function with one integer argument, and an argument which points to a function
	with one integer argument and no return type, that returns a pointer to an function with
	an integer argument and no return type.
