Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 18, exercise 4

Let f be the following function. What will be the value of f(10) if f has never
been called before? What will be the value of f(10) if has been called fives times
previously

static variables are initialised only once prior to the program execution.
The value of f if f has never been called before is 10 * 0 = 0.
The value of f if f has been called 5 times before is 10 * 4 = 50.

inf f(int i){
	static int j = 0;
	return i * j++;
}
