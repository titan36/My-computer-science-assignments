Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 9, exerice 7

Suppose that the function f has the following definition:

int f(int a, int b) { ... }

which of the following statements are legal? (Assume that i has type int and x has type double.)

(a) i = f(83, 12);
	Legal.

(b) x = f(83, 12);
	Legal.

(c) i = f(3.15, 9.28);
	Legal, but will lose fractional part as the parameters are converted to int and the value of i is integer by conversion rules.

(d) x = f(3.15, 9.28);
	Legal, same as above but the reuslt will have a fractional part as promoted to double.

(e) f(83, 12);
	Legal, however nothing is done with the result.
