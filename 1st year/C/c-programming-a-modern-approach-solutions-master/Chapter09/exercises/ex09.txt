Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 9, exerice 9

What will be the output of the following program?

#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int a, int b);

int main(void){
	int i = 1, j = 2;
	swap(i, j);
	printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);
	return 0;
}

void swap(int a, int b){
	int temp = a;
	a = b;
	b = temp;
}


The result of this program will be "i = 1, j = 2". C is pass by value, variables
a and b are only swapped inside the function with no modification to i and j.
