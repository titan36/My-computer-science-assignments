 * Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 9, programming project 5
 *
 * Modify programming project 17 from chapter 8 so that it includes the following
 * functions:
 *
 * void create_magic_square_(int n, char magic_square[n][n]);
 * void print_magic_square(int n, char magic_square[n][n]);
 *
 * After obtaining the number n from the user, main will call create_magic_square,
 * passing it an nxn array that is declared inside main. create_magic_square will
 * fill the array with the number 1,2,..m2 as described in the original project.
 * main will then call print_magic_square which will display the array in the format
 * described in the original project.
