Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 17 programming project 5

Write a program that sorts a series of words entered by the user:
Enter word: foo
Enter word: bar
Enter word: baz
Enter word: quux

In sorted order: bar baz foo quux

Assume that each word is no more than 20 characters long. Stop reaading when the user enters an empty word.
Store each word in a dynamically allowcated string, using an array of pointers to keep track of the strings,
as in remind2.c program (section 17.2). After all words have been read, sort the array (Using any sorting
technique) and then use a loop to print the words in sorted order.
