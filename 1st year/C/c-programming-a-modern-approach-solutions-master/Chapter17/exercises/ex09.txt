Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" Chapter 17, Exercise 9

True or false: if x is a structure and a is a member of that structure, then (&x)->a is the same
as x.a. Justify your answer

struct sample{
	int a;
} x;

True. (&x)->a is an indirected pointer to a, thus is the same as x.a. 

(&x)->a is the same as doing (*(&x)).a
