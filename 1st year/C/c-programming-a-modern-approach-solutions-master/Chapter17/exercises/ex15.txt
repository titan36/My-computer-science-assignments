Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" Chapter 17, Exercise 15

Show the output of the following program, and explain what it does

#include <stdio.h>
int f1(int(*f)(int));
int f2(int i);

int main(void){
	printf("Answer: %d\n", f1(f2));
	return 0;
}

int f1(int (*f)(int)){
	int n = 0;
	while((*f)(n))
		n++;
	return n;
}

int f2 (int i){
	return i * i + i - 12;
}

The program contains two functions. F1 takes arguments of a pointer to an integer function, in this case f2. 
f1 will execute f1 while the number of positive, and essentially how many functions calls to f2 were made. 

The output of this program is 3.
