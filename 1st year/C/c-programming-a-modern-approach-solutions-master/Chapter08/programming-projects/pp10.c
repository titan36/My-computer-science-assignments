 * Solution to "C Programming A Modern Approach" chapter 8, programming project 10
 *
 * Modify Programming Project 8 from Chapter 5 so that the departure times are stored in
 * an array and the arrival times are stored in a section array. (The times are integers representing
 * the number of minutes since midnight). The program will use a loop to search the array of 
 * departure times for the one closest to the time entered by the user user.
