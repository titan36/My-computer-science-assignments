Solution to "C Programming A Modern Approach" chapter 8, exercise 1

Q: We discussed using the expression sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) to calculate the number
   of elements in an array. The expression size(a) / sizeof(t), where t is the type
   of a's elements, would also work, but it's considered an inferior technique. Why?

A: If the type of a changes in a large program the source will have to be modified
   to support the change of type.
