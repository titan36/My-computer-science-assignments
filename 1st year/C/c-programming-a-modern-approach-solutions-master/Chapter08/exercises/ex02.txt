Solution to "C Programming A Modern Approach" chapter 8, exercise 2

Q: The Q&A section shows how to use a letter as an array subscript. Describe
   how to use a digit (in character form) as a subscript. 

A: Using the subtract operator on two chars will promote both chars to ints, so doing 

   int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
   printf("%d", a['2' - '0']); 

   is the same as a[2 - 0] and so the expression will print the 2nd element (3)
