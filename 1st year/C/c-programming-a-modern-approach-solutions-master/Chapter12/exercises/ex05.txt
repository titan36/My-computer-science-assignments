Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 12, exercise 5.

Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable. Assuming
that the assignment p = a has just been performed, which of the following
expressions are illegal because of mistmatched types? Of the remaining
expressions, which are true (Have a nonzero value)?

The name of an array can be used as a pointer to the first element
in the array.

p = a

(a) p == a[0]
False, this is equal to comparing &a[0] to a[0]. 

(b) p == &a[0]
True, same as comparing &a[0] to &a[0]. As p is a pointer to a[0]

(c) *p == a[0]
True

(d) p[0] == a[0]
Pointers may be used as an array name. In this case we are comparing
a[0] == a[0] which is true.
