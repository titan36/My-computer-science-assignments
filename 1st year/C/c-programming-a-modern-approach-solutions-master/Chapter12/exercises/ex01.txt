Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 12, exercise 1.

Q: Suppose that the following declarations are in effect:
   int a[] = {5, 15, 34, 53,14 ,2, 52, 72};
   int *p = &a[1], *q = &a[5];

(a) What is the value of *(p+3)?
The value of this expression is 14. 

(b) What is the value of *(q-3)?
The value this expression is 34

(c) What is the value of q - p;
Subtracting a pointer from another pointer is equal to the difference
between the two pointers measured by the index the point at. This expression
equates to 5 - 1 = 4.

(d) Is the condition of p < q true or false?
Comparison operators used with points test against their relative positions
they hold in the array; they must be in the same array. This expressions
is evaluated as 1 < 5, which is true

(e) Is the condition of *p < *q true or false?
This this expression tests against the value in memory the pointers
point at. The expression is evaluated as to 15 < 2, which is false.
